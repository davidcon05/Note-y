# Note-y
Note taking app. Course app to teach ViewModels but lets get crazy. 

## Todo
- FAB on MainScreen to open Create Note Screen
- MainScreen will just be a RecyclerView / Lazy column of note cards
- We'll use ViewModel to communicate between MainScreen and Create Note Screen
- Create Note Screen will have input field for note title and text
- Feature addition here would be formatting options for note
- Create screen will need back button in app bar to cancel out of Create New Note
   - Save button for saving note
   - Alert dialog maybe on the back button if there is text in the note
   - This requires navigation implementation
